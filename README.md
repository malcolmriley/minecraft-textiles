# The_Paragon's Wily Textiles Mod
A Minecraft Forge mod centered around the acquisition of textile-like items from alternative sources.

If you're tired of sleepless nights spent mugging Spiders for their string, then this is the mod for you!

## Features
* A **String** analogue, **Twine** and ways to craft it from foraged grasses
* A new crop, **Flax**, which can be used to create **Twine** or simply raw **Plant Fibers**
* A handy **Basket** block, for capturing fallen items
* A way to get more out of **Spider Webs**, by recrafting them into **Silk**
* A way to create **Chainmail Armor** pieces, via **Chain Mesh**
* ... And more to come! Maybe! We'll see!

## Attributions and Credits
* Certain **JSON Model Files** were made using [BlockBench](https://blockbench.net); these files are denoted as such by their `credit` field.
* Also, thanks and appreciation to **Minecraft Forge** contributors without whom projects like these would probably not exist.

## Addenda
* Like the textures but hate the mod? Get them from my other repository, [unused-textures](https://github.com/malcolmriley/unused-textures), and do as you will!
