![](wiki-images/basket-small.png) ![](wiki-images/crop-flax.png) ![](wiki-images/fiber-small.png) ![](wiki-images/fabric-yellow-small.png)

A Minecraft Forge mod centered around the acquisition of textile-like items from alternative sources.

If you're tired of sleepless nights spent mugging Spiders for their string, then this is the mod for you!

## Features
* A **String** analogue, **Twine** and ways to craft it from foraged grasses
* A new crop, **Flax**, whose stalks can be used to create **Twine** or simply raw **Plant Fibers**, and whose blossoms can be used to craft **Dyes**
* A handy **Basket** block, for capturing fallen items
* A way to get more out of **Spider Webs**, by recrafting them into **Silk**
* A way to create **Chainmail Armor** pieces, via **Chain Mesh**
* A way to convert wooden items into other varieties using **Wood Stain** and **Wood Bleach**
* ... And more to come! Maybe! We'll see!
